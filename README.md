- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcusanthonylorenzo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in simulation games, Wrestling/Brazilian Jiujitsu/MMA, Central Asian history (Mongol expansion), and groovy House music.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all Front-End technologies with a focus on React. (And, eventually, Python or any server-side language really!)
