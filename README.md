## Hey all, my name's Marcus! 

I began self-studying front-end technologies in late-November 2021.
After only 4 months of dedicated self-curriculum, I hope my progress is quite clear! Believe me when I say: I study hard and work methodically...I will become a Software Developer in 2022/2023!

Some of my favorite things are:
 - Simulation games,
 - Wrestling, Brazilian Jiujitsu, MMA.
 - Central Asian history (Mongol expansion),
 - Groovy House music, Tears For Fears ("shout...SHOUT..."), and most 80's rock/synthwave.
