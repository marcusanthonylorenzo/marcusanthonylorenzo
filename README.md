## Hey all, my name's Marcus! 

I began self-studying front-end technologies in late-November 2021.
After only 4 months of dedicated self-curriculum, I hope my progress is quite clear! Believe when I say: I study hard and work methodically!

Some of my favorite things are:
 Simulation games,
 Wrestling/Brazilian Jiujitsu/MMA,
 Central Asian history (Mongol expansion),
 and groovy House music.
